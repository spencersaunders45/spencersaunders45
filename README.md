## ðŸš€ Professional Experience
Currently, I work as an Application System Engineer Assistant at BYU-I, where I use Python, Selenium, and OOP principles to write clean, readable, and efficient code that automates work processes. One of my notable achievements is automating the updating of over 12,000 accounts in BYU-I's ticketing application, as well as automating the finding and merging of duplicate accounts in the system. I also place a strong emphasis on documentation to ensure that my code is easy to understand and maintain.

## ðŸŒ± Approach to Coding
I believe that coding is an iterative process and that feedback is key to improving your skills. I take pride in writing clean, readable, and efficient code that can be easily maintained and scaled. I'm always looking to learn new technologies and approaches to problem-solving.
